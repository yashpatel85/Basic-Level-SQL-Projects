📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer purchase trends using SQL. It explores customer behavior, product demand, and seasonal trends to provide actionable insights for businesses.

📂 Dataset
Customers: Customer details (ID, Name, Location).

Orders: Purchase transactions (Order ID, Customer ID, Date, Total Amount).

Order_Items: Product-wise details for each order.

Products: Product details (Product ID, Name, Category, Price).

📊 Key Objectives

✅ Identify top-spending customers.
✅ Analyze monthly and seasonal purchase patterns.
✅ Determine the best-selling products.
✅ Find repeat customers and loyalty trends.

🛠️ Technologies Used

2️⃣ Customer Segmentation (Top Spenders, Repeat Customers)
3️⃣ Purchase Trends (Monthly, Seasonal)
4️⃣ Product Analysis (Best-Selling, Least-Selling)

📜 Sample Queries

-- Top 5 customers by total spend
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5;
